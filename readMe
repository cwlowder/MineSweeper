MineSweeperTopHatter
by Curtis Lowder

Description:
    This is my submission for the Top Hatter Mine Sweeper problem. It is designed to solve a MineSweeper game.

How to run:
    To run the code, run the main command in the Main class.
    Note: the default configuration will run the AI players only.
        if you want to run the code in a mode that will allow a human to play,
         change the variable in the Main class SHOULDAIPLAY from TRUE to FALSE


Running the code with SHOULDAIPLAY set to true will run two major parts to the code: the probabilistic and random AI.
The probabilisticPlayer is the main focus of this program. The randomPlayer is only meant as a control to compare performance.

    basically, the technique the original MineSweeper used to make sure your first click was never a bomb
